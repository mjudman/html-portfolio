<h1>The Best Movies According to Mark</h1>
<h2>The Top Movies (that I can currently think of)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>It's not as easy as it looks. George Lucas made a movie that's slam-bang fun.</p>
<h3>Forbidden Planet</h3>
<p>A great early mind-boggling sci-fi film. It probably launched thousands of science and engineering careers.</p>
<h3>Soap Dish</h3>
<p>A hilarious comedy that's actually lots of laughs.</p>
